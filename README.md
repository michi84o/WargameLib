Modding Library for the Commandos Games

This is a free library that lets you access the texture archives (WAD) of the Commandos games.
Currently it is only tested for 'Behind Enemy Lines'.

The reason why I started this library is the poor performance of the GoG release.
While the original disk release runs too fast, the GoG version runs very laggy 
and too slow on some 'older' PCs (I'm talking Dual Core 3.1 GHz).

The goal of this project is to replace the original exe file completele so we can
actually enjoy the game instead of waiting for it to load. This will probably never
happen, but you should be allowed to have dreams ;-)
